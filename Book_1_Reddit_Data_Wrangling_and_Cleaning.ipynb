        "Predicting stock market movement and trends is of great interest to both individuals and companies. In order to make informed and secure decisions, traders need to forecast stock trends - determine buy/sell opportunities. The stock market is notoriously difficult to predict, stocks are inherently volatile. Besides the traditional historical analysis of the stock data there are several socio-economic external factors, such as social media and financial news.\n",
        "\n",
        "We are living in the day and age of fast media and information. News, thoughts, emotions are constantly shared instantly. Social media has millions of users posting hundreds of millions of posts daily - there are many outlets for millions of users to share information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditionally stock market analysis solely took an interest in the historical movement of the stock pricing. This is not enough anymore, not with the growing social media presence of companies and how quickly that information is shared worldwide.\n",
        "\n",
        "Social media sentiment analysis provides insights into positive or negative views on stocks, trends and the company itself. Sentiment about companies, about stock movements are shared on a regular basis. To analyze this sentiment is crucial to navigate the complex field of stock market analysis."
